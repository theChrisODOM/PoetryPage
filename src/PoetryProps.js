For gold is cold and lifeless and cannot see nor hear, and in time of trouble, it is powerless to cheer.  Gold it has no ears to listen, no heart to understand, it cannot briong you comfort, or reach out a helping hand.

Once your goal is sharply, but realisticly defined, all that remains is carrying out your plan.  Don't worry, however, about your individual potential.  Potenial is only the expression of possibility.  Something that can be assessed accurately only in retrospect.

For we do not have a high priest who is able to feel sympathy for our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are.  Yet HE did not sin.  Let us then approach GOD's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may recieve mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.  So if you think you are standing firm, be careful so that you don't fall. No temptation have overtaken you, except what is common to man kind, and GOD is faithful.  HE will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bare.  But when you are tempted, HE will also provide a way out, so you can endure it.\""),
